# TFLint VSCode Extension (Experimental)

> ⚠️ **Experimental!** This is a proof-of-concept VS Code extension for linting Terraform files using [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint). It is not production-ready and the API or behavior may change. Use at your own risk.

## Features

- Runs **TFLint** on Terraform files (`.tf`) in your workspace.  
- Attempts to automatically detect a `.tflint.hcl` config file in the workspace.  
- Displays linting diagnostics directly in VS Code.
